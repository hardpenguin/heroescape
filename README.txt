Hero Escape is a turn-based mini game you can finish in one minute. Your task it avoiding traps and monsters to escape the level. You can move two squares in your turn (but only horizontally/vertically) while monsters can move one square in their turn (but also diagonally). Make use of spells that are stored in magical scrolls around the map. Be smart!

After each run your score will be shown. Try to reach the highest one!
